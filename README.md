# SQL Injection Detection and Prevention Using Predictive Analytics

### Project Description
This application is about detecting and preventing sql injection queries entering into the back-end database.

By executing the **Project.py** file,it will open a page where it asks you for username and password and that is the place for attacker to inject the malicious queries.Here we had deployed a model in **users/views.py** to detect those queries.
